##  Project Overview

This project involves building a system that can:
1. **Recognize individuals** from facial features (face recognition)
2. **Identify emotional states** (emotion analysis: happy, sad, angry, etc.)

The system uses deep learning (mainly CNNs, possibly RNNs) to process images or videos and output identity and emotion.  
Later stages will involve multi-task learning and real-time performance tuning using tools like **Grad-CAM**, **heatmaps**, and **quantization**.
