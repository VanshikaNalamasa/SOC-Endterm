## üìå Project Overview

This project explores **recognizing handwritten code or digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
The final goal is to build a complete deep learning pipeline capable of identifying and interpreting handwritten programming code.  
We're starting by working with digit recognition (MNIST), then moving to face recognition and beyond.
